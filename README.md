# Boron Connections

Adds several new gates connecting Boron sectors to the rest of the universe. Two versions, one that requires 7thCore's Sector Farnham's Legend and one that sticks to vanilla/official expansion sectors.

## New Gates
- Ocean of Fantasy < - > Getsu Fune
- Watchful Gaze < - > Emperor's Pride
- Atreus' Clouds < - > Silent Witness I (Farnham's Legend if using Farnham Legend version)

##  Thanks
- DeadAir for helping figure out how to handle activating with the Kingdom End quests. As well for his mods, which this mod should pair well with.
- Entissus for helping brainstorm connections.
